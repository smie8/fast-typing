FastTyping is a typing test web-application, i.e. a guick typing test for measuring typing speed as words per minute (WPM). 

You have 60 seconds to type as many words that you can, correctly. Words per minute is calculated by international standard: sum of all correct word's charaters (including spaces) divided by 5. Misspelled words do not count, even if they have some correct characters. You can choose your typing language between Finnish and English, and words to be typed are generated randomly from word list arrays, that contain thousand or more of most commonly used words in each language. During typing if you begin to misspell a word, it's background color changes to red. Correctly typed words are highlighted in green. When the timer reaches zero you'll be presented some statistics.

That's it. Have fun typing! You can try FastTyping directly using this link: https://raw.githack.com/smie8/fasttyping/master/
